# Svelte Kit & Svelte

## Routing

## Form and Actions

Forms are made to work both with and without JavaScript. They 'degrade' nicely.
Some form effects such as animations rely on a 'directive' called `enhance`. It is added to an opening form tag, eg `use:enhance>`



## Server files

load function

API functions:

- PUT
- POST
- PATCH
- GET
- DELETE


# Project structure rules

- the reserved `src/lib` folder is for shared libraries
- a folder name is a route path
- a file `+page.svelte` is the view file for that path
- a file `+server.`
